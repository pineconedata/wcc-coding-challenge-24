# WCC Coding Challenge 2024
This project was developed within the framework of the [Women Coding Community](https://womencodingcommunity.com/)'s Christmas Coding Challenge for 2024. WCC asks that each participant: 
1. Create a repository on their GitHub account.
2. Add the description: "This project was developed within the framework of the Christmas Coding Challenge 2024, organized by Women Coding Community."
3. Make daily commits to their repository.
4. Share their progress in the Slack channel to confirm their daily commitment.
*Note*: Any missed days can be made up by completing the commits later and informing the Slack channel once caught up.

## Challenge Goal
To make a bit of progress (at least one commit) on this project every day for the duration of the challenge (25 days). Progress will be tracked in this GitHub repo and in the WCC Slack channel.

## Project(s) Selected
1. Broken Link Validator
2. Cookie Scraper
3. Django App

If one project is completed before the challenge ends, the next project in the list will be started.

## Results
During the 25 days of the challenge, there were [43 commits](https://github.com/pineconedata/wcc-coding-challenge-24/commits/main/broken-links?since=2024-12-01&until=2024-12-25) made to the repository. Roughly half a dozen of those commits were documentation, and the rest were code changes. Additional commits were made after the project deadline to further improve functionality and documentation.
